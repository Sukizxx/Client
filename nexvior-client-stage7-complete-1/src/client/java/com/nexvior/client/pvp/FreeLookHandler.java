 * Holds the current Free Look camera offset (extra yaw/pitch applied ONLY

 *
 * This class is intentionally "dumb" — it just stores two floats and
 * whether Free Look is currently active. The actual mouse-look input
 * capture and the camera-render override live in FreeLookMixin, kept
 * separate so the mixin stays as small and low-risk as possible.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this offset is READ ONLY by the render-side Camera mixin. It
 * must never be written to the player's actual yaw/pitch fields, which is
 * what keeps this feature from affecting server-perceived look direction.
